# Development

For development, you should add the plugin for a working project. I used RocketMouse project but every ready unity project can be used.

You should add `SibcheStoreKit.unitypackage` to the project and edit the files and improve plugin.

# Publish

For publishing, we should select `Editor`, `Plugins`, `SibcheStoreKit` directories in asset view and export them as a plugin.

After then, we should open a new release in github and upload this file to the github release
